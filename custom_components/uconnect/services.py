"""Service definitions for UConnect (T-Mobile) integration.

Services are registered on integration load and removed on unload.
Each service maps to a remote command supported by the UConnect cloud API.
Vehicle-specific services are only registered when the connected vehicle
reports that command in its `supported_commands` list.
